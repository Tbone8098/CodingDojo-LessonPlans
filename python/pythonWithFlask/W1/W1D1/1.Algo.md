### Ultimate Goal: Earning a Belt
Everyone's goal by the end of this stack is to ***earn a belt*** and have a **project completed**.  The required assignments are designed to prepare you to earn a Red Belt.  In some of the assignments you will see bonus challenges.  These will help prepare you to earn a Black Belt, the highest honor.  At the end of each day, be sure to complete all of the required assignments.  If you still have time, work on the bonus features.  The optional assignments are designed for those who are ahead during the bootcamp and for you to come back after completing the bootcamp to continue to level up in Python.

### Reading vs. Doing
While the *reading is important*, it is best utilized as supplemental to the actual doing of assignments. <span class="highlight-yellow">Learn By Doing!</span> Don't spend too much time trying to understand all the reading prior to starting an assignment. Instead, read through the content for a few minutes to get an idea of what you'll be learning and to have a reference to come back to. Definitely code along if there are code blocks, to start seeing the code in action. Then start working through the assignments. <span class="highlight-yellow">And Reference the material constantly</span> We believe in learning by doing and strength through struggle--as you actually work through the assignments, the content will make more sense because you'll have a context for all the jargon and code snippets.

This methodology is probably contrary to the traditional schooling you're used to, but don't be afraid to jump in and make mistakes. That's where the best learning happens!

<span class="highlight-yellow">So Why Python?</span>

1. readability
1. libraries
1. community
1. scope
1. easy
---
**Reiterate**
1. Popular: plenty of community support
1. Shallow learning curve: easy to learn
1. Minimal setup: quick to get started
1. Understandable: code is written in plain English
1. Fast development cycle: get something going fast; optimization is available  later if needed

--- 
Organization is ***KEY***

### python SHELL 
<div class="watchout-bg">
    <span class="watchout-text">This is a little less important at this moment. </span>
</div>
<span class="question">what is the shell?</span>
<span class="answer">The shell is a command line interface we can use to interact with the Python interpreter. Similar to how we were able to use our web browser's console to run JavaScript, the Python shell allows us to run Python code in our terminal. Once activated, we can type some Python code and see the results immediately. Let's try it out by simply typing python in our terminal:</span>

TO ENTER SHELL: in the terminal type python or python3 (mac)

<span class="highlight-green">Notice:</span> **>>>** means you are in the shell

TO EXIT SHELL: exit()

<span class="question">What can we do in the shell?</span>
<span class="answer">It is a place where we can write python. So any python code we can write in the shell.</span>

- Math
- functions
- run python files
