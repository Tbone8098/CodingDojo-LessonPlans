## redirecting
<span class="question">What is redirecting and Why do we want to redirect?</span>

**Two ways to think of routing**
1. Display methods
1. Actions methods

<span class="important">!Important!</span> We don't want to mix the two!

## session
<span class="question">What is session and why do we have it?</span>
A place where we save, or write, certain valuable pieces of data for use in future cycles. This data is stored on the user's browser and not on the the server that is running the everybodies instance of the website. 

<span class="question">What useful data might we want to persist over multiple function calls?</span>

- user login 
- Temperary variables (info that is only carried from one method to another)
- Where the user has been in the past

Session is not secure, so you don't want to store sensitive information inside session. 

### Setup Session in Flas
1. import session
1. setup secret_key
    ```python
    app.secret_key = "some secret here"
    ```
1. set a session var
    - What dataType is this? 
        - remember it is just a dictionary
        - How do we set up a new var in any dictionary?
            - dict['key'] = value
    ```python
        session['key'] = "some_value"
    ```
1. How to get information from session
    ```python
    session['key']
    ```
1. delete from session
    - session.clear()
    - session.pop(key)

## Hidden Inputs

<span class="question">What is a hidden input and why would we use one?</span>

<span class="important">!Important!</span> Remeber to emphasize the dataType of inputs. They are just dictionaries.
