## Four Pillars

1. Encapsulation

    Encapsulation is the idea that we can group code together into objects; hence Object Oriented Programming. We use classes or "coding blue prints" to define what our objects are and how they behave. We encapsulate attributes and methods in our class.
    
1. Inheritance

    Inheritance is the idea that we pass along attributes and methods from one class into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work.  Child classes can be more specific versions of their Parent class.  Using the key word "super" will call methods

1. Polymorphism

    Polymorphism means "many forms", and the idea in OOP is that a Child class can have a different version of a method than the Parent class. In this example the child class of CappuccinoM has a clean method, and so does CoffeeM. Depending on the class, the clean method will do different things.

1. Abstraction

    Abstraction is an extension of Encapsulation, and we can hide attributes or methods that a Barista doesn't need to know about, like a CoffeeM. That way the Barista can make a cup of coffee in a simpler manner.
