## Virtual Environments

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand what a virtual environment is</li>
        <li>How to setup a virtual environment</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>

<span class="say">
    <ol>
        <li>What is a virtual Environment?</li>
        <li>What is the purpose of the VENV?</li>
        <li>Why do we use it?</li>
    </ol>
</span>

### Installing env

STEPS

1. install venv
    - Mac:
        ```
        pip3 install pipenv
        ```
    - windows:
        ```
        pip install pipenv
        ```
1. create new project folder
1. install flask to that project folder
    ```
    pipenv install flask
    ```
1. activate the virtual environment
    - Activate
        ```
        pipenv shell
        ```
    - Deactivate
        ```
        exit
        ```

## Hello Flask

1. Create a <span class="highlight-yellow">server</span> file
1. Put in boilerplate code

    ```python
    from flask import Flask  # Import Flask to allow us to create our app
    ```

    ```python
    app = Flask(__name__)    # Create a new instance of the Flask class called "app"
    ```

    <div class="question">What is an instance?</div>
    <!-- TODO: answer what is an instance -->
    <div class="answer">answer</div>

    ```python
    @app.route('/')          # The "@" decorator associates this route with the function immediately following
    ```

    <div class="question">What is a "Route"? <span class="important">!Important!</span></div>
    <div class="answer">The URL in the browser.</div>

    ```python
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'  # Return the string 'Hello World!' as a response
    ```

    <div class="question">What is the <span class="highlight-grey">hello_world()</span> ?</div>
    <div class="answer">A Function. You will find that programs are full of functions.</div>

    ```python
    if __name__=="__main__":   # Ensure this file is being run directly and not from a different module
    app.run(debug=True)    # Run the app in debug mode
    ```

    <div class="answer">This needs to go at the bottom of your code.</div>

1. Run our server file.
    <div class="answer">Really easy to do...run this command in your terminal</div>

    ```python
    python server.py
    ```

<div class="answer">Congrats! You have created your first application!!</div>

### THINGS TO REMEMBER

-   We need to import Flask
-   We need to make an instance of the Flask class
-   We need to set up the routes using "@" decorator
-   run the app

## Routes

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is a route</li>
        <li>What are the parts of a route</li>
        <li>What are the methods</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>

Two parts of a route in flask.

<div class="question">Based off of the example above can you identify the "Route" component?</div>

PART 1:

```python
    @app.route('/')          # The "@" decorator associates this route with the function immediately following
```

PART 2:

```python
    def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'  # Return the string 'Hello World!' as a response
```

<div class="answer">for every route that we have we need to have both parts.</div>

<div class="question">What do you think would happen if we had two methods with the same name?</div>

### POST vs GET

<div class="question">Describe a conversation. what are the parts of it?</div>

<div class="answer">
We would call these Methods. 
</div>
<span class="important">!Important!</span> Don't get confused with methods (or functions) in python.

### Take-a-ways:

1. two parts of a route -> route & the function
1. two types of data being transferred. Get (i want something) POST (I am giving you something)

## Rendering Views

<div class="question">based off the name, what do you think this will do?</div>

<div class="answer">It will render or display an HTML page for the end user to see. </div>

STEPS

1. First we need to import the method (function) we need to use.
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template
    ```
1. Then we can use it in our methods
    ```python
    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
    # Instead of returning a string,
    # we'll return the result of the render_template method, passing in the name of our HTML file
    return render_template('index.html')
    ```

## Template Engine

<div class="question">What is a template engine?</div>

<div class="answer">it is a way for us to do logical code (ie: for loops, if statements, calling variables) inside a HTML file.</div>

<span class="highlight-tan">Examples:</span>

```HTML
<h3>My Flask Template</h3>
<p>Phrase: {{ phrase }}</p>
<p>Times: {{ times }}</p>

{% for x in range(0,times): %}
    <p>{{ phrase }}</p>
{% endfor %}

{% if phrase == "hello" %}
  <p>The phrase says hello</p>
{% endif %}
```

## Static Files

<div class="question">Based off of the name, what are static file? what does static mean?</div>

<div class="answer">content that does not change. Remember that the normal person is not the developer who is creating the content, instead the normal person is the end user. The way the page looks for the end user will rarely change and therefore it is static, while the content on the page may indeed change as "a blogger adds a post" or a photographer adds a picture or maybe you like the photo and therefore it gets a +1 on the like scale.</div>

-   Static organization

-> static <br>
----> css <br>
--------> style.css <br>
----> img <br>
--------> img.png <br>
----> js <br>
--------> script.js <br>

-> templates <br>
----> index.html <br>

<span class="important">!Important!</span> **The _static_ file and the _templates_ file MUST be lowercase and spelled exactly the same as above**

### Important note:

<div class="answer">Because static file don't normally change on the user the browser will "cash" them so that load times will get faster. but because we as developers are always changing them, we need to do a "hard refresh"</div>
