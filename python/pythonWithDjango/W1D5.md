| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model/Model     | - May build database tables, Handles logic that relies on data. - Interfaces with the database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| View/Controller | - Receives incoming requests, - Minimal logic, Calls on models to aggregate/process data, - Determines appropriate response, - <span class="important">!Important!</span> Question to ask...Does the function return a response? -yes: it is a view and you can put it in the views.py file. - No: it is not a view so put it somewhere else |

### Notes:

-   using a single file is fine for small personal projects (flask)
-   imagine working at a big company with thousands of lines of code

## Creating a Django VENV

### Create it

| Type                      | Command                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Mac/Linux:                | python3 -m venv djangoPy3Env |
| Windows (command prompt): | python -m venv djangoPy3Env  |

### Activate your environment

| type                      | command                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Mac/Linux:                | source djangoPy3Env/bin/activate     |
| Windows (command prompt): | call djangoPy3Env\Scripts\activate   |
| Windows (git bash) :      | source djangoPy3Env/Scripts/activate |

### Install Django

| install Django              |                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| (djangoPy3Env) Windows/Mac: | pip install Django==2.2.4 |

<div class="question">What is the purpose of installing django 2.2.4 in stead of the latest version?</div>

<div class="answer">A lot of times a company will still be functioning on a earlier version of some software and it is expensive to upgrade to the latest version. For us we know what we will be teaching you will work on 2.2.4 and at the moment we are functioning by the saying, "if it ain't broke don't fix it."</div>

## Starting a Django Project

Django does a **LOT** of the heavy lifting for us. We just have to run a couple commands and django builds out the file structure. As far as it goes Flask was a pretty flexible frame work, if you wanted to do it your way (for the most part) you can in flask. Which is great, This is both a strength and a weakness you are probably not the smartest person "in the room." However, when it comes to Django, you kind of have to do it the django way. This is also a strength and a weakness. You loose flexibility however lots of smart people have gotten together and created a better way to do things - The Django way.

### My checklist to start a django project

1.  In your terminal in the folder you want the project to live type:

    ```
    django-admin startproject your_project_name_here
    ```

1.  CHECK THE SERVER TO MAKE SURE IT IS RUNNING!

    -   navigate into the folder you just created

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    -   This will start the server on <span class="highlight-grey">localhost:8000</span> by default. <p class="question">This is an important step because it is a check for you to know that the server is running up to this point.</p>

1.  Modifying your settings file

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'your_app_name_here', # added this line. Don't forget the comma!!
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ]    # the trailing comma after the last item in a list, tuple, or dictionary is commonly accepted in Python
    ```

1.  adding your app to your path

    <div class="answer">Remember that there are two levels you have to keep in mind when working with django. You have your project level. This is like your umbrella, everything else is inside of the project. Then you have your app level. You can have many apps in one project. Later when working on your own you can figure out how to split up your program so that it is in pieces. This is called modularizing your program. What this does is allows you to use that login and reg code in many programs without having to rewrite it over and over again. So you might have a login and reg app, a e-commerce app, and a gallery app. All these apps together would make up your website/project </div>

    -   project level **url.py** file
        <div class="question">what is a URL?</div>

            <div class="answer">You can think of parts of the URL as Road Signs. They guide the program to the correct function (also sometime giving the function what it needs)</div>

        ```python
        from django.urls import path, include           # import include
        # from django.contrib import admin              # comment out, or just delete
        urlpatterns = [
            path('', include('your_app_name_here.urls')),
            # path('admin/', admin.sites.urls)         # comment out, or just delete
        ]
        ```

        -   This urls.py file is where you include all your apps that are apart of your project.
        -   You might (if you have multiple apps have many URL PATHS here. These would be the first thing you would see in your URL after the 8000/)
        -   It is like the first road sign.

    -   app level **url.py** file

        ```python
        from django.urls import path
        from . import views
        urlpatterns = [
            path('', views.index),
        ]
        ```

            <div class="question">If the project level urls.py file points to the app then the app level urls.py file will point to what? Look at the "from . import views" what does the "." mean? what is views?</div>

            -  Parts of the PATH.
                - URL
                - file location in which to look
                - function name to look for.
                - there are more attributes but we won't get into them at the moment.

1.  adding your functions/methods and testing the server to make sure it works.

    -   app level **views.py** file

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("this is the equivalent of @app.route('/')!")
    ```

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Remember the flow of the code

Code is kind of like a stream. It can only flow one direction.

<div class="question">How does the computer read a file? in which direction does it read it?</div>

<div class="answer">Top to bottom, Left to right</div>

the urls.py file is always looking for a change to the url in the browser. When it sees a change it looks (based off that url) for the direction in which to go. If it can't find it, it will give you an error and let you know exactly where it looked and what it was looking for. (Django is amazing with its errors. You just have to read).

### The Flow

1. The project level passes the flow to the app level
1. the app level urls.py passes the flow to the views
1. the views pass the flow to the function (method)
1. the method passes the flow to the
    - HTML file
    - back to the urls.py file with a redirect
1. the computer either renders the page or runs another function.
1. repeat...

## Routing with Parameters

-   variables getting passed through the URLs works the same way as with Flask. You use the "<>" and you can declare what variable type it is by using the "int:"

    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
        path('bears', views.one_method),                        # would only match localhost:8000/bears
        path('bears/<int:my_val>', views.another_method),       # would match localhost:8000/bears/23
        path('bears/<str:name>/poke', views.yet_another),       # would match localhost:8000/bears/pooh/poke
    	path('<int:id>/<str:color>', views.one_more),           # would match localhost:8000/17/brown
    ]
    ```

    -   **The code sees variables first**

-   those variable must be specified inside the route method as a parameter.

    ```python
    def one_method(request):                # no values passed via URL
        pass

    def another_method(request, my_val):	# my_val would be a number from the URL
        pass                                # given the example above, my_val would be 23

    def yet_another(request, name):	        # name would be a string from the URL
        pass                                # given the example above, name would be 'pooh'

    def one_more(request, id, color): 	# id would be a number, and color a string from the URL
        pass                                # given the example above, id would be 17 and color would be 'brown'
    ```

## Templates

templates work the same way as they did in flask. The file must be named templates (lowercase and plural) plus you **HAVE** to make sure that you are importing the method at the top of your file.

### Passing data into a template

-   Context in the views
      <div class="question">What is the context? what data type?</div>

So we pass info into the HTML file the same way as Flask however we only pass one item in which is a dictionary and we can pull any info we put into the dictionary.

-   context in the HTML
    -   While jinja2 in flask and django are technically different, they are pretty much exactly the same.
    -   You can call variables using the double {{}}
    -   You can use logic with the {%%}

## Static Files

Also work the same way as in flask.

-   The file **MUST** be named static
-   recommended file structure
    -   static
        -   css
            -   style.css
        -   img
        -   js
            -   script.js

the only difference is in the templating language

-   MUST load static - {% load static %}
-   calling a static file - {% static 'file path starting from the static file and going down' %}
