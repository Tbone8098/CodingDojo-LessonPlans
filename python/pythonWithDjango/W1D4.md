## Making an Env

## What is a Webapp

1. What is a webapp?
1. What are the parts of a webapp?
    - client side
        1. What the client?
    - server side
        1. what is the server?

<hr>

## Install Flask

```python
(py3Env) pip install Flask
```

OR

```python
(py3Env) pip3 install Flask
```

<hr>

## Hello Flask

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Install Flask</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>

The purpose of a task like this is to do a check to make sure the bare minimum is working before making things more complicated.

1. setting up the server element
    ```python
    from flask import Flask  # Import Flask to allow us to create our app
    app = Flask(__name__)    # Create a new instance of the Flask class called "app"
    ```
1. Building out routes
    - pay attention to the "@" decorator this will be the route (URL) in which the server is looking for.
    - what is the URL --> just for further clarification.
    ```python
    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'
    if __name__=="__main__":
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
    <span class="highlight-green">Pay Attention to the <u>**_if statement_**</u> This **MUST** be at the end of your page. </span>

<hr>

## Routes

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the importance of routes</li>
        <li>Understand the parts of a route</li>
        <li>Id how and when to use GET</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>

1. What is the purpose of routes?
    - Two parts, HTTP methods, URL
1. What is a route?
    - Has two parts:
        - HTTP methods (GET,POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
        - URL
1. How do we pass information from one end of the webapp to the other?
    - In Flask && others but is dependent on the framework.
    - Variable names inside a URL
    - <span class="highlight-tan"> STEPS: </span>
        1. syntax for a variable inside a URL is <name_of_var>
        2. call the SAME var name inside the parameters of the method/function.
        EXAMPLE:
        ```python
        @app.route('/hello/<name>')
        def hello(name):
            print(name)
            return "Hello, " + name
        ```
    - ASK: <span class="say">What side of the webapp are we working here?<span>

<hr>

## Rendering

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand what templates are in Flask</li>
        <li>Know where to save HTML files</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>

ASK: <span class="say">What side of the webapp do you think we will be working with here?<span>

<span class="highlight-tan">STEPS</span>

1. Need to import something called "render_template"

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template  # added render_template!
    ```

    - ASK: <span class="say">What do you think "render_template" is?</span>
    - It is a function from some other file that we are importing into our file in order to use it.

1. ASK: <span class="say"> what is "hello_world" ? </span>
    - it is another function/method. --> you will find that all programming uses function/methods all over the place.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template  # added render_template!
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    # Instead of returning a string,
    # we'll return the result of the render_template method, passing in the name of our HTML file
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

```

<hr>

## Templates

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand what a template engine is</li>
        <li>Learn how to pass data from the server to the HTML</li>
        <li>Learn the Jinja2 syntax for displaying data from the server in the HTML</li>
        <li>Learn how to use Jinja2 to perform Python logic in the HTML</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>
 
ASK: <span class="say">We have a way to pull information from the front-end (client) and pass it to the back-end (ish...server) Does anybody remember how we do this?<span>
- Communication is a two way street. We have one way from passing variables through the URL but now we need to be able to pass information the other way. 
```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template("index.html", phrase="hello", times=5)
```
we can pass variables through the render page. This is great but now the question is <p class="say"> how would we access them from the html file? </p>
<p class="highlight-green">This is also dependent on the framework that is being used. </p>

<span class="highlight-tan">Types:</span>

1. structures
    - {% for x in some_var %} {% endfor %} <span class="important"> MUST HAVE THE END TAG! </span>
    - {% if some_condition %} {% endif %}
1. calling a variable
    - {{ var_name }} --> double curlies

<hr>

## Static

<div class="obj"> 
<p class="title">OBJECTIVES</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Know what static content is in the context of web development</li>
        <li>Know where to put static files in a Flask web application</li>
        <li>Learn how to access our static content in our HTML files</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<br>


ASK: <p class="say">What does "static" mean? </p>

This is content that is created that is not going to be changed once the webapp is up and running.

ASK: <p class="say"> What are some files that you might think would be in static? </p>
Files could include...

-   Stylesheets
-   images
-   javaScript file

<span class="highlight-yellow">Key Points:</span>

-   the File **MUST** be called _"static"_
-   Because static file don't usually change the browser tends to cash them. You may need to do a hard refresh
    -   Mac: <span class="highlight-grey">cmd + shift + r </span>
    -   Windows: <span class="highlight-grey">ctrl + shift + r </span>

while the organization structure is up to you there is a standard way of organizing it.

```
--static
    |
    -- css
    |
    -- img
    |
    -- js
```
