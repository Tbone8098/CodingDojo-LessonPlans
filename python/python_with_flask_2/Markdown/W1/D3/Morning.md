## 4 Pillars of OOP

APIE

1. Abstraction
   - only show neccessary details to the use of the object
   - End user only cares about calling the method and not how that method is written
1. Polymorphism

   ```
   Words come from greek or latin, does anybody know what polymorph means when broken down?
   ```

   - Comes from the words
     - Poly -> Many
     - Morph -> Forms
   - Allows you to determine what kind function to run while the program is running

1. Inheritance
   - Code reuseablilty ++
   - classes down the line are usually called...
     - Subclass
     - Extended Class
     - Child Class
   - Classes that are more "senior"
     - Parent Class
     - Super Class
     - Base Class
   - Can use methods of the parent class without rewriting them HOWEVER if you rewrite them then they will use the new method for that class.
1. Encapsulation
   - Data hiding
   - Creating getters and setters

# Class Project

Have the class create at least two classes. 1. the parent class or super class and the 2nd being a class that inherits from the parent class.

## Posible ideas

- employees
- chair
- **transportation**
- mamals
